The market was valued at <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> in 2023, reflecting a strong upward trend fueled by technological advancements and changing consumer preferences. The integration of electric bikes with mobile applications has made renting easier and more accessible, contributing to the surge in user adoption.</p> <p>Forecasts predict that the electric bike rental market will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>15% from 2024 to 2032</strong>. By 2024, the market size is projected to reach <strong>$1.72 billion</strong>, increasing to approximately <strong>$3.52 billion</strong> by 2028. This growth can be attributed to investments in infrastructure and government initiatives promoting sustainable urban mobility. Additionally, the post-pandemic emphasis on outdoor activities and social distancing has further encouraged individuals to consider bicycle rentals as a safe and healthy mode of transport.</p> <p>Another key driver behind the market's expansion is the increasing popularity of subscription-based rental services.
